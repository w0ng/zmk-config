# ZMK Config Instructions

## Important Workflow Notes

- **When updating `config/corne.keymap`:** Always update `README.md` to reflect any changes to:
  - Homerow mod assignments
  - Layer layouts
  - Key positions or behaviors
  - Thumb key configurations

Keep the README in sync with the keymap to ensure documentation accuracy.

## Git Commit Policy

- **When "accept edits" is enabled:** Do NOT create git commits until the user explicitly tells you to
- Wait for explicit user approval before running `git commit` commands
- The user will tell you when they're ready to commit changes
